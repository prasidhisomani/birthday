<div class="panel">
  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>Really don’t know from where to begin, Went to oyo, my first time to oyo, with S. I came 6 fucking times. I can still feel his finger’s sensations over there🙈 We kissed, we cuddled, we almost had sex, we showered together, we laughed, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to rap, we ate pizza. I don’t think there is anything we are left to do with🙈 Those moments when he held me in his arms, when his fingers were in there, when his tounge was teasing me, when he was sucking, god! I guess I had the best bed experience today. I had all of my firsts with S🙈infact, I gave him a blowjob, which I thought I won’t give it to anyone🙈. Iam so going to miss S when I’ll eat, when I’ll lie down, when I’ll shower😭 The best part about the entire day was, when it rained, and we smoked together🤤 Every moment, every kiss, every cuddle. God, I love him so so so so so much. I wish he feels the same. I wish he never stops loving me. I wish he never leaves me. I wish we have the best memories with each other🙈 We had a very difficult conversation tooo, which still is leaving me breathless. It kills me to remember the one conversation.</p>
  <P><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>Ummmm. 😐
Okay. 😐
Hello guchi muchi puchi poo poo.😂
So it all started when I woke up today with the thought of spending at least 6 hours with her today🥰. That thought while waking up was the starting of the best feelings I was going to have today. We met, I guided her to the hotel, we checked in, we went to the room and boom, there was it the first best kiss we had👄. we kissed so hard and so passionately, her lipstick was all over my face💋. Came back after going home for 5 minutes, and FUCK we started kissing so passionately again🙈. Made snaps, cuddled with clothes on, she unbuttoned me, we started having an amazing kiss and one thing led to another then another and there we were without clothes in a blanket in a chilled room in each other's arm in a hotel😍🙈. I touched her everywhere LIKE EVERYWHERE🙈🤭, I gave her so many love bites, all over her boobs and she gave me hickeys too, a lot of hickeys. I know it was not the first time I've been in bed with someone, but yes this was my FUCKING BEST BED EXPERIENCE EVER🤯. We made love, almost had sex but yeah we controlled thanks to her🤗. There was nothing which we were left to do, we hugged, we kissed, we removed each other clothes, we pushed each other in bed, we showered, we ate, we discussed things, we laughed, we smoked, we saw the rain, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to muhfaad and krishna, there is like nothing left in my life anymore that I've not done today with her💕, now I'm going to miss her while I do anything😭. I made her laugh, I made her laugh so hard and that feeling of making my princess laugh that was the best I could imagine ever❤️🤩. She came 6 times🙈🤭. She is so great with making those expressions, those moaning voices and when she called my name in between of doing that, FUCK🤐. I had the best blowjob of my life ever, fuck she is so great with everything.🤷🏻‍♂️
P👑 still doubts me😔, I think it's just my love that is lacking somewhere, maybe my love is not enough for her.🥺
I felt bad for just one thing, she paid for everything. She paid for the hotel charges and for the food also, that felt so bad, I'll repay her.😭
THE BEST FUCKING DAY OF MY LIFE.</P>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>I have no words, idk where to begin with. Iam speechless and stunned. We met today, me and s🙈 I was super mad at him when we met. We went to malt for coffee, and guess what ? 😂 our coffee date turned into an orgasm date😂🙈 yes we made out in public, yes he gave me an orgasm in malt♥️ I so crave for his fingers rn. I so crave for his touch rn♥️our first ever make out in public🙈♥️ then, when I was dropping S at his place, mom asked me to come in. And In that moment, I got butterflies, i was nervous yet excited. S asked me to come in🙈 I went in, I met S’s aunty, went up🙈 met mom♥️ S’s mom, my mom😘 We sat and we talked and talked and talked. S made so many snaps🙈🙈🙈♥️ Mom made milk rose for me, I felt so good🤤 Then when I said I should leave, she stopped me, she said that wait for a while and that’s when I felt home, I felt wanted. I felt as if iam not a guest here😘 Then papa came, he was, like from what I felt, a bit happy to see me there🙈 I again asked to leave, because S wanted me to leave, and mom again asked me to stay and meet papa🙈♥️papa went, bathed and got ready and came out to meet, fully and beautifully dressed🙈 I was playing sequence with mom, and I wanted her to win so me and mom cheated🙈 papa came and we were getting late so couldn’t play sequence with him. Me and papa spoke about GST. 🤤 
The best part of the entire meet when mom said that she is my mom too 🙈♥️ no one has ever said this to me. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one has</p>
  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>One of the biggest days of my life🤯. No words and emotions are enough to express how the day was😍. One thing I'm sure about is that this was one of the best days of my and P's👑 life. Dammmmm I'm falling in love with her day by day, she's so amazing, and one thing now I'm 10000000% sure about is that her happiness is everything that matters to me.🌍
    So today,</p>
  <p>💟P👑 getting super angry ☑</p>
  <p>💟Made out in a cafe ☑</p>
  <p>💟Making her meet our parents ☑</p>
<p>She came to pick me up from my home, she was super angry with me🤬, my fault, I accept🥺. She was super serious while talking to me but what do I do, I can't stop smiling or laughing when I'm around her🙈, she was so irresistible, she didn't allow me to touch her but as I'm super cute I was touching her again and again🙈😍.
As we are so super great🌶️ we discussed it out and went to have a coffee🥤, saw Malt on the way, and just went there to have a tasty coffee ☕, amazing smoke🚬, and a decent conversation🥰 but ended up with a super amazing snap coffee👻☕, deadly orgasm😈, cigarettes after orgasm🚬 and blushing faces🙈.
P👑 just says one line "I want an orgasm rn" and the next minute my fingers are inside her always🙈. We made out in public🙈, one of my fantasy to make out in a public restroom ☑, We went in the washroom and then there we were my fingers inside her and my dick in her mouth🙈. When we were finished doing it the expressions on her face were deadly😳.
  We went back and this was the first time we talked about our kids 🙈
We had soda from my favorite soda shop, went to Bhai Bhai, laughed a lot.
She was dropping me back to my house, mumma was standing in the balcony, I asked her to come out of the car and say Hi to mom🙂, mumma asked her to come upstairs, she said no but I don't know what happened to me, what did I feel, I asked her to come upstairs😚. She agreed. I was taking her, she met chachi, Ashu di smiled, and she waved Hi to Avi. And there was the moment two favorite people of my life❤️, they met each other. P sat with my mom, talked a lot I was super crazy🤯. Mumma went in kitchen to make milkrose for all of us, I showed her my room at that time, took her to my room and kissed her there😘, my first kiss with her In my room.
Showed her the washroom, and kissed her there also👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨, She came out and we again started talking, I was so happy at that moment, I saw my two favorites talking to each other🙈❤️, Mumma was laughing, P 👑 was happy made so many snaps, I was waiting for papa to come so that P👑 can meet papa too. Mumma herself called that she is P's mumma too. We started to play a game of sequence, I wanted her to win so I gave her a double eyed jack but she cheated and made mumma win🙈, God Iloveher💋. Papa came, papa was so happy to see her and the smile on P's face seeing dad was so super amazing I wish I captured that😣. Papa was dressing up to meet her, he came out and we all sat together. Me, mumma, papa, P👑 basically my family was there, I so felt like home🏘️.
Papa and P👑 talked about GST and I see my dad and his daughter-in-law discussing about things🙈.
Everyone at my home liked P👑, and at last as everything that matters to me is also checked today, MAKING P👑 HAPPY ☑</p>

  <p>Yet another day of not meeting S. didn’t know that it will be this difficult! Maybe it’s my overthinking or my insecurity that is taking over me and me and S are having arguments almost daily. I so wish these arguements stop, not even a single day has been there where we haven’t argued. I hope S isn’t having any thoughts because of these arguments. I don’t want to loose him. I don’t want to do anything stupid and make him leave me. I don’t want him to give up, guess he is already doing it. 😭</p>
