<div class="panel">
  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>Really don’t know from where to begin, Went to oyo, my first time to oyo, with S. I came 6 fucking times. I can still feel his finger’s sensations over there🙈 We kissed, we cuddled, we almost had sex, we showered together, we laughed, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to rap, we ate pizza. I don’t think there is anything we are left to do with🙈 Those moments when he held me in his arms, when his fingers were in there, when his tounge was teasing me, when he was sucking, god! I guess I had the best bed experience today. I had all of my firsts with S🙈infact, I gave him a blowjob, which I thought I won’t give it to anyone🙈. Iam so going to miss S when I’ll eat, when I’ll lie down, when I’ll shower😭 The best part about the entire day was, when it rained, and we smoked together🤤 Every moment, every kiss, every cuddle. God, I love him so so so so so much. I wish he feels the same. I wish he never stops loving me. I wish he never leaves me. I wish we have the best memories with each other🙈 We had a very difficult conversation tooo, which still is leaving me breathless. It kills me to remember the one conversation.</p>
  <P><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>Ummmm. 😐
Okay. 😐
Hello guchi muchi puchi poo poo.😂
So it all started when I woke up today with the thought of spending at least 6 hours with her today🥰. That thought while waking up was the starting of the best feelings I was going to have today. We met, I guided her to the hotel, we checked in, we went to the room and boom, there was it the first best kiss we had👄. we kissed so hard and so passionately, her lipstick was all over my face💋. Came back after going home for 5 minutes, and FUCK we started kissing so passionately again🙈. Made snaps, cuddled with clothes on, she unbuttoned me, we started having an amazing kiss and one thing led to another then another and there we were without clothes in a blanket in a chilled room in each other's arm in a hotel😍🙈. I touched her everywhere LIKE EVERYWHERE🙈🤭, I gave her so many love bites, all over her boobs and she gave me hickeys too, a lot of hickeys. I know it was not the first time I've been in bed with someone, but yes this was my FUCKING BEST BED EXPERIENCE EVER🤯. We made love, almost had sex but yeah we controlled thanks to her🤗. There was nothing which we were left to do, we hugged, we kissed, we removed each other clothes, we pushed each other in bed, we showered, we ate, we discussed things, we laughed, we smoked, we saw the rain, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to muhfaad and krishna, there is like nothing left in my life anymore that I've not done today with her💕, now I'm going to miss her while I do anything😭. I made her laugh, I made her laugh so hard and that feeling of making my princess laugh that was the best I could imagine ever❤️🤩. She came 6 times🙈🤭. She is so great with making those expressions, those moaning voices and when she called my name in between of doing that, FUCK🤐. I had the best blowjob of my life ever, fuck she is so great with everything.🤷🏻‍♂️
P👑 still doubts me😔, I think it's just my love that is lacking somewhere, maybe my love is not enough for her.🥺
I felt bad for just one thing, she paid for everything. She paid for the hotel charges and for the food also, that felt so bad, I'll repay her.😭
THE BEST FUCKING DAY OF MY LIFE.</P>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>I have no words, idk where to begin with. Iam speechless and stunned. We met today, me and s🙈 I was super mad at him when we met. We went to malt for coffee, and guess what ? 😂 our coffee date turned into an orgasm date😂🙈 yes we made out in public, yes he gave me an orgasm in malt♥️ I so crave for his fingers rn. I so crave for his touch rn♥️our first ever make out in public🙈♥️ then, when I was dropping S at his place, mom asked me to come in. And In that moment, I got butterflies, i was nervous yet excited. S asked me to come in🙈 I went in, I met S’s aunty, went up🙈 met mom♥️ S’s mom, my mom😘 We sat and we talked and talked and talked. S made so many snaps🙈🙈🙈♥️ Mom made milk rose for me, I felt so good🤤 Then when I said I should leave, she stopped me, she said that wait for a while and that’s when I felt home, I felt wanted. I felt as if iam not a guest here😘 Then papa came, he was, like from what I felt, a bit happy to see me there🙈 I again asked to leave, because S wanted me to leave, and mom again asked me to stay and meet papa🙈♥️papa went, bathed and got ready and came out to meet, fully and beautifully dressed🙈 I was playing sequence with mom, and I wanted her to win so me and mom cheated🙈 papa came and we were getting late so couldn’t play sequence with him. Me and papa spoke about GST. 🤤 
The best part of the entire meet when mom said that she is my mom too 🙈♥️ no one has ever said this to me. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one has</p>
  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>One of the biggest days of my life🤯. No words and emotions are enough to express how the day was😍. One thing I'm sure about is that this was one of the best days of my and P's👑 life. Dammmmm I'm falling in love with her day by day, she's so amazing, and one thing now I'm 10000000% sure about is that her happiness is everything that matters to me.🌍
    So today,</p>
  <p>💟P👑 getting super angry ☑</p>
  <p>💟Made out in a cafe ☑</p>
  <p>💟Making her meet our parents ☑</p>
<p>She came to pick me up from my home, she was super angry with me🤬, my fault, I accept🥺. She was super serious while talking to me but what do I do, I can't stop smiling or laughing when I'm around her🙈, she was so irresistible, she didn't allow me to touch her but as I'm super cute I was touching her again and again🙈😍.
As we are so super great🌶️ we discussed it out and went to have a coffee🥤, saw Malt on the way, and just went there to have a tasty coffee ☕, amazing smoke🚬, and a decent conversation🥰 but ended up with a super amazing snap coffee👻☕, deadly orgasm😈, cigarettes after orgasm🚬 and blushing faces🙈.
P👑 just says one line "I want an orgasm rn" and the next minute my fingers are inside her always🙈. We made out in public🙈, one of my fantasy to make out in a public restroom ☑, We went in the washroom and then there we were my fingers inside her and my dick in her mouth🙈. When we were finished doing it the expressions on her face were deadly😳.
  We went back and this was the first time we talked about our kids 🙈
We had soda from my favorite soda shop, went to Bhai Bhai, laughed a lot.
She was dropping me back to my house, mumma was standing in the balcony, I asked her to come out of the car and say Hi to mom🙂, mumma asked her to come upstairs, she said no but I don't know what happened to me, what did I feel, I asked her to come upstairs😚. She agreed. I was taking her, she met chachi, Ashu di smiled, and she waved Hi to Avi. And there was the moment two favorite people of my life❤️, they met each other. P sat with my mom, talked a lot I was super crazy🤯. Mumma went in kitchen to make milkrose for all of us, I showed her my room at that time, took her to my room and kissed her there😘, my first kiss with her In my room.
Showed her the washroom, and kissed her there also👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨, She came out and we again started talking, I was so happy at that moment, I saw my two favorites talking to each other🙈❤️, Mumma was laughing, P 👑 was happy made so many snaps, I was waiting for papa to come so that P👑 can meet papa too. Mumma herself called that she is P's mumma too. We started to play a game of sequence, I wanted her to win so I gave her a double eyed jack but she cheated and made mumma win🙈, God Iloveher💋. Papa came, papa was so happy to see her and the smile on P's face seeing dad was so super amazing I wish I captured that😣. Papa was dressing up to meet her, he came out and we all sat together. Me, mumma, papa, P👑 basically my family was there, I so felt like home🏘️.
Papa and P👑 talked about GST and I see my dad and his daughter-in-law discussing about things🙈.
Everyone at my home liked P👑, and at last as everything that matters to me is also checked today, MAKING P👑 HAPPY ☑</p>

  <p>Yet another day of not meeting S. didn’t know that it will be this difficult! Maybe it’s my overthinking or my insecurity that is taking over me and me and S are having arguments almost daily. I so wish these arguements stop, not even a single day has been there where we haven’t argued. I hope S isn’t having any thoughts because of these arguments. I don’t want to loose him. I don’t want to do anything stupid and make him leave me. I don’t want him to give up, guess he is already doing it. 😭</p>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>One of the best and worst day of my life🥺 My parents and S’s parents met each other😋 I so wanted them to meet but not like this😔S met with an accident and when S called and said, i was so so so scared. When I saw S,I was so relieved that nothing major has happened💫S came to my house for the first time🙈 S’s parents met my mom🙈 The conversations, all that my mom said, S’s parents said🙈 Everything was super cute and super amazing, I felt so so so good. But iam upset too, S is in pain and iam not with him to comfort him🥺I don’t know when iam going to see my S again🥺</p>
  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>It was 4 PM and we agreed to meet👩‍❤️‍👨, I told her I'll be there. I was there to see her after days okay not days 🤭, she was wearing suit, she looked pretty😍. We dedicated songs to each other, I dedicated "You and I" she dedicated "PerfectTwo", we looked in each other's eyes🙈 listening to the songs and holding hands🙌, which is inexplicable. We hugged🤗, we kissed😘, we cuddled🥰. We were returning back I said see you super super super super super soon", she replied, "bol toh aise raha hai jaise shaam ko hi vaapis milega"🤩 and her words came true. I met her again after 20 mins in the worst way possible😣. I met with an accident, a bad accident, the worst I had ever😰. Called her, she came just in 5 mins😬. The expression that worried face of her, I wish nothing ever happens again so she looks that worried again😔. She helped me to stand up, she held my hand in public and took me to the hospital🏥. Mumma was also coming with the driver behind her, we reached the hospital "Shah Hospital" and that was the first time I met mumma🙈. She came to me asked me "beta kaise ho". We went in I never saw my P worried so much and wish I never see her again like this😳. While the nurse was dressing my wounds she was moving here and there for me🥺, My mom called and she talked to her, she comforted her and that was the first time my mom and her mom talked to each other💕. Papa called, again P talked to him. The nurse was dressing my wound P came and pulled down my T-shirt and said "Only I have the right to see you without clothes no-one else"😍🙈. P held my hand in front of mumma and took me to the car, it was decided that we are going to P's house. For the first time, I was going to P's house, my house which was my dream but not like this😞. We went in. That feeling of being seated in her car and moving in her house. She held my hand in her house and helped me in walking to her door, Raghav opened the door. For the first time, I saw her house, my house 🏠. She took me to the room helped me lying on the bed, Raghav came we talked, and finally, Gudia Di came. Me, P, Mumma, Raghav and Gudia di, we all were there😍. Mumma got Haldi vaala doodh for me. We had so much fun. There was a moment when it was just me, P and Gudia Di in the room, we laughed a lot😁. It was a dream come true. my parents reached, they came in P brought them in. FUCK❤️🥰, my family, her family everyone was together. They were talking. both of my mumma cried, Gudia di cried, papa cried, P controlled her tears, thank god👐. It was Me, Papa, Mumma, Avi, P, Gudia Di and Mummy in the room just papa was missing☹️. P took snaps. I wish could have stayed there for more time. Then we were going back and that time mumma said this "Jaise twinkle hai mere liye vaise hi ye bhi bacha hi hai hamara"🙈😍🙈. I just realized that me and P are moving ahead, we are taking steps further in our life. And it's not just us destiny is helping us, universe is helping us❤️. We both are so happy, our families are happy, I wish it stays this way only. 🦚

I love P more than anything💕 and all she has done for me I'll never be able to repay her for that😔. One of the worst day and best day, but let's see good in everything OUR FAMILIES MET❤️, WE ARE TOGETHER❤️ AND MOVING FORWARD❤️.</p>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>I met S after his accident today, even though S told me that he could walk and he was in less pain as compared, but I could savour the relief only I saw S with my own eyes. I was sick worried and after seeing him I felt somuch better🙈 We went to smoke for a while as we couldn’t go to home at that point of time😋Finally, we went to his place and I met mom dad for the second time😍 Till last night I was worried how things would be at his place or how would mom dad take me coming to his place😓 But it was all so so so so good💕It actually seemed as if mom dad are accepting me as S’s friend. Iam fine with being accepted as S’s friend, what matters is acceptance😋The only topic we 3 had in common was S and S’s leg pulling, and that is what we were doing🌈But I crossed a bit of line and I know that was wrong🥺I shouldn’t have done it🥺I was just trying to get more comfortable with mom and dad, but it turned out to be bad for S🤭Iam feeling so bad, cannnot even explain😓I really wish s forgives me 🥺 I wanted to kiss S in his room, but we couldn’t even though he was giving me surprise presses🙈🙈 I felt so turned on everytime he touched me😋It was so difficult to keep a straight face everytime S pretended you lick over there🙈 and S’s line”vapas tere sath nanga hona hai” Fuck that line🤤 I so cant wait to get in bed with him again😋😋I was about to leave and dad proposed to have dinner and I felt so so so so good💋 Mom made aloo parantha for us and I swear, i dont remember having such yummy food last💕 And then me and S had dinner together for the first time🤤It was our FIRST💕 S fed me with his hands and I fed him with mine. We kissed each other twice or thrice but with all precations🙈My favourite moment for the day was having dinner with S🤤 Fuck I felt so so so good💕💕 Iam feeling bad about what I did. I didn’t want to upset S even for a second and I did something super selfish. Just because I wanted to get comf with dad, I created a problem for S🥺🥺 I HOPE S FORGIVES ME🥺 I dont want this to come between me and s🥺 I feel as if my repeated stupidities would drift S apart from me🥺When I was leaving for home, papa asked me to drive safely and that’s when I felt home💕 That’s when I felt like family💕 I have met everyone in S’s family and now I want S to meet my entire family as soon as possible🤤We smoked and I dropped S back to home🙈 S removed the remaining of his dressings today😓 It kills me to know that iam not with him when I should be with him. It kills me to know that iam unable to comfort him🥺 I love S so so so so so much. I don’t want anything to get between me and S🥺

And the moment when his tounge went there, fuck fuck fuck. That moment when his tounge was there. Shit🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 I swear I felt as if iam in heaven. S has no idea what his tounge does to me🤭and after me being satisfied, I started sucking S’s dick🍆 Shit it was huge, fuck it was tasty🤤 I can still feel his taste in my mouth🤤 I gave him a deep throat and that, that made him super super super satisfied😋 Iam so happy that iam able to make S feel good with me🤤 And he finally came, he had an orgasm in car. He had an orgasm because of my BJ and HJ.🤤 We smoked. I wanted one more but S denied. I said that I would come over you and kiss you, and when I did that🤤 Fuck🍆 I could feel his ercetion. I could feel his huge dick rubbing me. And in that moment, I wanted to have sex with S💕 He then gave me an orgasm and I gave him one more. Fuck, we both came twice, and that too in a break of max 10 miniutes😋 We kissed and smoked again💋Today was superb. Today was something I can never feel again or experience again🤤 Iam so so so so in love with S, iam so blessed to have S in my life💕 Iam so happy that he is with me💕 I hope he loves me the same, I hope he feels the same💕 I love you S. be mine always🤤</p>
