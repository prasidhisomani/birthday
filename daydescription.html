<div class="panel">
  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>Really don’t know from where to begin, Went to oyo, my first time to oyo, with S. I came 6 fucking times. I can still feel his finger’s sensations over there🙈 We kissed, we cuddled, we almost had sex, we showered together, we laughed, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to rap, we ate pizza. I don’t think there is anything we are left to do with🙈 Those moments when he held me in his arms, when his fingers were in there, when his tounge was teasing me, when he was sucking, god! I guess I had the best bed experience today. I had all of my firsts with S🙈infact, I gave him a blowjob, which I thought I won’t give it to anyone🙈. Iam so going to miss S when I’ll eat, when I’ll lie down, when I’ll shower😭 The best part about the entire day was, when it rained, and we smoked together🤤 Every moment, every kiss, every cuddle. God, I love him so so so so so much. I wish he feels the same. I wish he never stops loving me. I wish he never leaves me. I wish we have the best memories with each other🙈 We had a very difficult conversation tooo, which still is leaving me breathless. It kills me to remember the one conversation.</p>
  <P><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>Ummmm. 😐
Okay. 😐
Hello guchi muchi puchi poo poo.😂
So it all started when I woke up today with the thought of spending at least 6 hours with her today🥰. That thought while waking up was the starting of the best feelings I was going to have today. We met, I guided her to the hotel, we checked in, we went to the room and boom, there was it the first best kiss we had👄. we kissed so hard and so passionately, her lipstick was all over my face💋. Came back after going home for 5 minutes, and FUCK we started kissing so passionately again🙈. Made snaps, cuddled with clothes on, she unbuttoned me, we started having an amazing kiss and one thing led to another then another and there we were without clothes in a blanket in a chilled room in each other's arm in a hotel😍🙈. I touched her everywhere LIKE EVERYWHERE🙈🤭, I gave her so many love bites, all over her boobs and she gave me hickeys too, a lot of hickeys. I know it was not the first time I've been in bed with someone, but yes this was my FUCKING BEST BED EXPERIENCE EVER🤯. We made love, almost had sex but yeah we controlled thanks to her🤗. There was nothing which we were left to do, we hugged, we kissed, we removed each other clothes, we pushed each other in bed, we showered, we ate, we discussed things, we laughed, we smoked, we saw the rain, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to muhfaad and krishna, there is like nothing left in my life anymore that I've not done today with her💕, now I'm going to miss her while I do anything😭. I made her laugh, I made her laugh so hard and that feeling of making my princess laugh that was the best I could imagine ever❤️🤩. She came 6 times🙈🤭. She is so great with making those expressions, those moaning voices and when she called my name in between of doing that, FUCK🤐. I had the best blowjob of my life ever, fuck she is so great with everything.🤷🏻‍♂️
P👑 still doubts me😔, I think it's just my love that is lacking somewhere, maybe my love is not enough for her.🥺
I felt bad for just one thing, she paid for everything. She paid for the hotel charges and for the food also, that felt so bad, I'll repay her.😭
THE BEST FUCKING DAY OF MY LIFE.</P>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>I have no words, idk where to begin with. Iam speechless and stunned. We met today, me and s🙈 I was super mad at him when we met. We went to malt for coffee, and guess what ? 😂 our coffee date turned into an orgasm date😂🙈 yes we made out in public, yes he gave me an orgasm in malt♥️ I so crave for his fingers rn. I so crave for his touch rn♥️our first ever make out in public🙈♥️ then, when I was dropping S at his place, mom asked me to come in. And In that moment, I got butterflies, i was nervous yet excited. S asked me to come in🙈 I went in, I met S’s aunty, went up🙈 met mom♥️ S’s mom, my mom😘 We sat and we talked and talked and talked. S made so many snaps🙈🙈🙈♥️ Mom made milk rose for me, I felt so good🤤 Then when I said I should leave, she stopped me, she said that wait for a while and that’s when I felt home, I felt wanted. I felt as if iam not a guest here😘 Then papa came, he was, like from what I felt, a bit happy to see me there🙈 I again asked to leave, because S wanted me to leave, and mom again asked me to stay and meet papa🙈♥️papa went, bathed and got ready and came out to meet, fully and beautifully dressed🙈 I was playing sequence with mom, and I wanted her to win so me and mom cheated🙈 papa came and we were getting late so couldn’t play sequence with him. Me and papa spoke about GST. 🤤 
The best part of the entire meet when mom said that she is my mom too 🙈♥️ no one has ever said this to me. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one has</p>
  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>One of the biggest days of my life🤯. No words and emotions are enough to express how the day was😍. One thing I'm sure about is that this was one of the best days of my and P's👑 life. Dammmmm I'm falling in love with her day by day, she's so amazing, and one thing now I'm 10000000% sure about is that her happiness is everything that matters to me.🌍
    So today,</p>
  <p>💟P👑 getting super angry ☑</p>
  <p>💟Made out in a cafe ☑</p>
  <p>💟Making her meet our parents ☑</p>
<p>She came to pick me up from my home, she was super angry with me🤬, my fault, I accept🥺. She was super serious while talking to me but what do I do, I can't stop smiling or laughing when I'm around her🙈, she was so irresistible, she didn't allow me to touch her but as I'm super cute I was touching her again and again🙈😍.
As we are so super great🌶️ we discussed it out and went to have a coffee🥤, saw Malt on the way, and just went there to have a tasty coffee ☕, amazing smoke🚬, and a decent conversation🥰 but ended up with a super amazing snap coffee👻☕, deadly orgasm😈, cigarettes after orgasm🚬 and blushing faces🙈.
P👑 just says one line "I want an orgasm rn" and the next minute my fingers are inside her always🙈. We made out in public🙈, one of my fantasy to make out in a public restroom ☑, We went in the washroom and then there we were my fingers inside her and my dick in her mouth🙈. When we were finished doing it the expressions on her face were deadly😳.
  We went back and this was the first time we talked about our kids 🙈
We had soda from my favorite soda shop, went to Bhai Bhai, laughed a lot.
She was dropping me back to my house, mumma was standing in the balcony, I asked her to come out of the car and say Hi to mom🙂, mumma asked her to come upstairs, she said no but I don't know what happened to me, what did I feel, I asked her to come upstairs😚. She agreed. I was taking her, she met chachi, Ashu di smiled, and she waved Hi to Avi. And there was the moment two favorite people of my life❤️, they met each other. P sat with my mom, talked a lot I was super crazy🤯. Mumma went in kitchen to make milkrose for all of us, I showed her my room at that time, took her to my room and kissed her there😘, my first kiss with her In my room.
Showed her the washroom, and kissed her there also👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨, She came out and we again started talking, I was so happy at that moment, I saw my two favorites talking to each other🙈❤️, Mumma was laughing, P 👑 was happy made so many snaps, I was waiting for papa to come so that P👑 can meet papa too. Mumma herself called that she is P's mumma too. We started to play a game of sequence, I wanted her to win so I gave her a double eyed jack but she cheated and made mumma win🙈, God Iloveher💋. Papa came, papa was so happy to see her and the smile on P's face seeing dad was so super amazing I wish I captured that😣. Papa was dressing up to meet her, he came out and we all sat together. Me, mumma, papa, P👑 basically my family was there, I so felt like home🏘️.
Papa and P👑 talked about GST and I see my dad and his daughter-in-law discussing about things🙈.
Everyone at my home liked P👑, and at last as everything that matters to me is also checked today, MAKING P👑 HAPPY ☑</p>

  <p>Yet another day of not meeting S. didn’t know that it will be this difficult! Maybe it’s my overthinking or my insecurity that is taking over me and me and S are having arguments almost daily. I so wish these arguements stop, not even a single day has been there where we haven’t argued. I hope S isn’t having any thoughts because of these arguments. I don’t want to loose him. I don’t want to do anything stupid and make him leave me. I don’t want him to give up, guess he is already doing it. 😭</p>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>One of the best and worst day of my life🥺 My parents and S’s parents met each other😋 I so wanted them to meet but not like this😔S met with an accident and when S called and said, i was so so so scared. When I saw S,I was so relieved that nothing major has happened💫S came to my house for the first time🙈 S’s parents met my mom🙈 The conversations, all that my mom said, S’s parents said🙈 Everything was super cute and super amazing, I felt so so so good. But iam upset too, S is in pain and iam not with him to comfort him🥺I don’t know when iam going to see my S again🥺</p>
  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>It was 4 PM and we agreed to meet👩‍❤️‍👨, I told her I'll be there. I was there to see her after days okay not days 🤭, she was wearing suit, she looked pretty😍. We dedicated songs to each other, I dedicated "You and I" she dedicated "PerfectTwo", we looked in each other's eyes🙈 listening to the songs and holding hands🙌, which is inexplicable. We hugged🤗, we kissed😘, we cuddled🥰. We were returning back I said see you super super super super super soon", she replied, "bol toh aise raha hai jaise shaam ko hi vaapis milega"🤩 and her words came true. I met her again after 20 mins in the worst way possible😣. I met with an accident, a bad accident, the worst I had ever😰. Called her, she came just in 5 mins😬. The expression that worried face of her, I wish nothing ever happens again so she looks that worried again😔. She helped me to stand up, she held my hand in public and took me to the hospital🏥. Mumma was also coming with the driver behind her, we reached the hospital "Shah Hospital" and that was the first time I met mumma🙈. She came to me asked me "beta kaise ho". We went in I never saw my P worried so much and wish I never see her again like this😳. While the nurse was dressing my wounds she was moving here and there for me🥺, My mom called and she talked to her, she comforted her and that was the first time my mom and her mom talked to each other💕. Papa called, again P talked to him. The nurse was dressing my wound P came and pulled down my T-shirt and said "Only I have the right to see you without clothes no-one else"😍🙈. P held my hand in front of mumma and took me to the car, it was decided that we are going to P's house. For the first time, I was going to P's house, my house which was my dream but not like this😞. We went in. That feeling of being seated in her car and moving in her house. She held my hand in her house and helped me in walking to her door, Raghav opened the door. For the first time, I saw her house, my house 🏠. She took me to the room helped me lying on the bed, Raghav came we talked, and finally, Gudia Di came. Me, P, Mumma, Raghav and Gudia di, we all were there😍. Mumma got Haldi vaala doodh for me. We had so much fun. There was a moment when it was just me, P and Gudia Di in the room, we laughed a lot😁. It was a dream come true. my parents reached, they came in P brought them in. FUCK❤️🥰, my family, her family everyone was together. They were talking. both of my mumma cried, Gudia di cried, papa cried, P controlled her tears, thank god👐. It was Me, Papa, Mumma, Avi, P, Gudia Di and Mummy in the room just papa was missing☹️. P took snaps. I wish could have stayed there for more time. Then we were going back and that time mumma said this "Jaise twinkle hai mere liye vaise hi ye bhi bacha hi hai hamara"🙈😍🙈. I just realized that me and P are moving ahead, we are taking steps further in our life. And it's not just us destiny is helping us, universe is helping us❤️. We both are so happy, our families are happy, I wish it stays this way only. 🦚

I love P more than anything💕 and all she has done for me I'll never be able to repay her for that😔. One of the worst day and best day, but let's see good in everything OUR FAMILIES MET❤️, WE ARE TOGETHER❤️ AND MOVING FORWARD❤️.</p>

  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>I met S after his accident today, even though S told me that he could walk and he was in less pain as compared, but I could savour the relief only I saw S with my own eyes. I was sick worried and after seeing him I felt somuch better🙈 We went to smoke for a while as we couldn’t go to home at that point of time😋Finally, we went to his place and I met mom dad for the second time😍 Till last night I was worried how things would be at his place or how would mom dad take me coming to his place😓 But it was all so so so so good💕It actually seemed as if mom dad are accepting me as S’s friend. Iam fine with being accepted as S’s friend, what matters is acceptance😋The only topic we 3 had in common was S and S’s leg pulling, and that is what we were doing🌈But I crossed a bit of line and I know that was wrong🥺I shouldn’t have done it🥺I was just trying to get more comfortable with mom and dad, but it turned out to be bad for S🤭Iam feeling so bad, cannnot even explain😓I really wish s forgives me 🥺 I wanted to kiss S in his room, but we couldn’t even though he was giving me surprise presses🙈🙈 I felt so turned on everytime he touched me😋It was so difficult to keep a straight face everytime S pretended you lick over there🙈 and S’s line”vapas tere sath nanga hona hai” Fuck that line🤤 I so cant wait to get in bed with him again😋😋I was about to leave and dad proposed to have dinner and I felt so so so so good💋 Mom made aloo parantha for us and I swear, i dont remember having such yummy food last💕 And then me and S had dinner together for the first time🤤It was our FIRST💕 S fed me with his hands and I fed him with mine. We kissed each other twice or thrice but with all precations🙈My favourite moment for the day was having dinner with S🤤 Fuck I felt so so so good💕💕 Iam feeling bad about what I did. I didn’t want to upset S even for a second and I did something super selfish. Just because I wanted to get comf with dad, I created a problem for S🥺🥺 I HOPE S FORGIVES ME🥺 I dont want this to come between me and s🥺 I feel as if my repeated stupidities would drift S apart from me🥺When I was leaving for home, papa asked me to drive safely and that’s when I felt home💕 That’s when I felt like family💕 I have met everyone in S’s family and now I want S to meet my entire family as soon as possible🤤We smoked and I dropped S back to home🙈 S removed the remaining of his dressings today😓 It kills me to know that iam not with him when I should be with him. It kills me to know that iam unable to comfort him🥺 I love S so so so so so much. I don’t want anything to get between me and S🥺 
My love my life my s💕</p>
  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>So finally🤩 I met P after my accident, I was very much worried about the thought that how am I going to meet her because my parents won't allow me to go outside😟. So there is a better way, the best way, to make her come to my house😍. I was really scared of how things will turn out between me, P mom and dad. I told P day before yesterday to come and be there at my place for 1-1:30 hours because after that it would be awkward☹️. She came but somethings happened at my house because of which I had to go downstairs and go out with her😅. We smoked as always and talked for a while. P was taking care of me like a mom🤭. We kissed also as usual💏. She gave me 12 days to go surprise, it was chips, nachos, kurkure, and chocolate🤤. It was around 6:30 I called Mumma to ask that can I bring Prasidhi, she said YESSS😍🥰. I and P were going to my house, our house. She is coming to the house for the second time, I was worried and happy also. I was worried would it be awkward for all of us to just sit around with silence around us and I was happy with the fact that she's coming to her own house again🙈🏘️. She came to the house, she met Chachi and we went upstairs. We were planning to go to the terrace but couldn't😕🥺. Mumma and avi came, we all sat together and talked about me, basically, they were doing my leg-pulling🤦. Mumma went in the kitchen to get snacks and ghevar, and meanwhile, I was teasing P by showing her my dick🤭. I was doing naughty actions to tease P. Dad came in a while and then we all were together🥳. Me, P, Mumma my family, her family. We all were talking, P said some things, I didn't like them, I think she crossed her limits☹️. I wish she never does that again ever or at least see where are we before doing such things😭. She was leaving as she was getting late but then papa proposed the idea to stay and have dinner😍. She talked to mumma (her mumma) and she agreed to have dinner. Chacha came and she met chacha then😚. Papa said to chacha that my friend is here let's go downstairs It was me, P and mumma upstairs, mumma was in kitchen and P was talking on call moving here and there, while she was in my room I followed her and pressed her boobs there🍑🙈. When she came to the kitchen I squeezed her ass🙈🍑 in front of mumma. There was a moment when P and mumma were standing in the kitchen and I just loved that moment. I made so many snaps of all the moments👻. Mumma served us dinner and we had it, mumma was cooking and meanwhile I kissed her💋 in between. We fed each other with our hands. THAT WAS P's FIRST DINNER AT MY HOUSE. I LOVED IT❤️. It was late and she had to leave. She talked to mumma for a while and she was going I came to drop her downstairs, she said bye to papa, chacha, chachi, ashu di and avi. We went for a cigarette🚬 and I've never seen her this much happy. That look on her face, that happiness, that smile, I LOVE THAT. 
I wish I keep P happy for the entire life, I wish she never leaves me, I wish I never do something stupid to lose a gem like her.💎🖤</p>

  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>29/07/2020 🙈
I and P completed one month together❤️. Many people around P including P were in doubt that would I stick with her for even a week🤔 and here we are completing and celebrating our one month together and many more to come yet😎. So today it was an amazing day. The highlight of the day was the best orgasms ever until now🙈🍑. We didn't have sex but still what we had today was so so so so amazing that it can't be explained🙈. So we finally decided to have Hookah finally💨. We met at socialite, it was tough reaching there but we had to meet☹️, it was a must and thank god we met because we had the best orgasms🤤. We met at socialite, we ordered a Hookah her favorite "Rasna-Royal Gold". We also ordered a coffee and nachos. We talked👫, we did some PDA💏, we teased each other🙈, we clicked so many photos📸 and made so many snaps👻. It was raining there and that was so beautiful🌧️. We were leaving and clicked so many photographs there, we kissed in the lift and clicked photos in there also📸. She was dropping me home but as always we can't get enough of each other and are always willing to stay more with each other🤭. We were on our way to my home, and on the way, we were crossing P's bhua's house, she asked me "Do you want to meet Harshi ?", I thought I was ready but I was shit scared to meet her as I'm always. Harshi came and three of us smoked🚬. Harshi's boyfriend came to pick her up, I and P were looking for a spot to kiss each other we were roaming here and there and finally reached a place, a super amazing place with no houses around and a perfect place for makeout💋🙈. We parked our car and started to kiss each other, and as always our kiss ended up in an orgasm🤤. But this time this orgasm was very different, it was the best orgasm I ever had and the best P ever had. I gave her an orgasm👌👈💦 and I was so turned on that I needed an orgasm at that point🍌💦. I pulled down my pants and asked her to give me a BJ🍆. FUCK, she knows very well how to satisfy me🙈🤤, she started giving me deep throat🍆. FUCK. The best feeling I ever had, she was giving me a super amazing BJ with deep throat and also a HJ at last, I ejaculated at last in the car itself on tissues🍆✊💦. She said she wants to come over me, she came over me we started making out again, She was rubbing her vagina on my dick, she was super turned on. I wish I could fuck her🤤. She went back to her seat but we were not done yet, we repeated all of this and gave each other one more orgasm. FUCK, THOSE ORGASMS WERE AMAZING🙈🤤🍆💦👌👈💦. I and P are going so well, I am so happy with her, I wish nothing separates her and this goes on forever between us. I wish we are always this much strong. I love you P and will do always.❤️🖤😍💋</p>

  <p>Super busy day🤭 I was busy with gudia di and S was busy with house work! S started trading without discussing it with me. And S’s reasons were that he was scared. Am I not able to make him feel comfortable with me🥺 We both we’re missing each other the entire day and we’re super excited to talk to each other at night. I may have overreacted a bit on small small things🥺 We had a really really bad conversation tonight🥺 For the first time I felt that maybe S is falling out of love from me🥺 I wish everything gets sorted! </p>

  <p><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span> So finally the day came😍 it was my birthday, 07 August 2020. My first birthday with P 👑, I already knew it is going to be amazing🙈. She has been gifting me gifts from the last 6 days😍🔥 all in the form of a countdown🖤. I've never felt so special and that too from six days before my birthday😍🙈. So about my birthday, at 12 she was the first one to wish me, so obvious😅. She was on the conference call when others were wishing me🤤. After I was done taking most of the calls she gave me the first surprise, a video🎦. This was the first time anyone made a video for me a video so amazing😍🙈. The video started with her thoughts and then a slideshow of my photos and after that, it was Bhayia, P, Tharki Log, Sonali, Arushi Di wishing me in that, The video was so amazing I loved it😍  I watched it twice or thrice repeatedly💕. Some more wishes were there she was either on vc or on the conference call with me💟. She wished me and we slept😴. I woke up early, it was my day and I was so excited for all she was planning🤩🥳. I was ready by 10 and all of the family came upstairs. Avi made a cake for me🎂, I did cut the cake and we had fun, mumma made aloo pakoda as breakfast🤤. I got ready after that, I wore formals hoping that P would like me in those😍. Booked a cab and went to meet her, I was a bit late just 10 mins, not my fault, I was ready on time🥺😔. She came there, she was wearing a dress, one-piece she was looking so hot and sexy😈, Oh fuck she looks like a PRINCESS 👸. We purchased a box of cigarettes and went to my surprise. She drove me to a place, a resort-type something where she had already booked a room. One more surprise, She asked Avi and Ashu Di also to come there for a surprise, she invited Tharki Log also but they didn't come😐😔. We entered the room and there was my surprise, a room so beautifully decorated, I loved it😍💕🙈. There were red and black balloons, and there were HAPPY BIRTHDAy balloons also on the wall🎈, there were some frills, The room was looking so beautiful but not more than my P 👑. She arranged a cake 🍰 and I was cutting a cake while she was making my snap👻. We all drank some alcohol🥃, smoked some cigarettes🚬, and were having fun, We were talking about my relationship with Pri and Ashu Di was telling how immature I behaved in that relationship. In addition to this P did something😢. I've warned her before also to not cross the line again but don't know what is wrong with her she crossed her line today again😭😐 and that too after a warning. A few moments later Avi and Ashu Di left from there and it was just me and P in the room🙈😈. We can't resist each other for more than a second, I jumped on P and we started making out. We were kissing so passionately💋, and I was touching her again and again here and there. While I was kissing her badly I was fingering her as well👌👈💦, FUCK her expressions her moaning, her screams🤩🤤 they are so fucking amazing and turns me on so much that I was asking P just the next minute that "Can we have sex?"😐🥺. After some discussion, we agreed on this point that we can have sex but just one time💋. And the next minute my penis🍆 was on her vagina, I started pushing it in, she was screaming, I could see her in pain😐. I never wanted my P to go through something like this but this is something that she has to do once in a lifetime🥺 and I think that it was the moment. I held P. I started pushing it again, of course, it was troubling her but I cannot do anything except holding her🥺😍. But after some time it was fine with P it was still paining but she was having more fun than the pain🙈.I was doing it again and again and at last, she started to have fun, completely fun💋🍆💦. I was fucking her, it was not fucking it was what we call making love it was so good. She was having a lot of fun, her expressions her screaming her moaning and all the things she was was saying, FUCK👄. One thing I know for sure this girl can satisfy me in love❤️ and in bed🛌 also. We fucked really hard and when we were done we cuddled and hugged each other💕 but our hugging and cuddling were, again and again, turning into other rounds of sex👄🍆👌💦. I opened her explosion box in between, it was so beautiful, it was so pretty I loved it❤️😍🙈. But there were many personal photos and that's why I couldn't bring it home🥺😔. We had sex 4 times. FUCKING 4 TIMES🍆👌💦💦. Every time it was so fucking great and what I love is her expressions, her screaming, her moaning, and all the things she says in bed👄🍆. We smoked many times in between. And then we had to leave. It was all about the day, I still can't believe that P gave her virginity to me🤤. I am so much in love with her, I am never leaving her and never going to do anything that she will regret having me in her life.❤️💕</p>

  <p>So the pinnacle of the day is that Me S Raghav and Madhav went out today🙈S was meeting raghav for the first time🙈I was so nervous how S would feel when he’ll meet rghav😪 But both of them were smooth like butter😅S bonded more with madhav but that’s fine, he’ll bond with raghav to🙈 Me and S had, I would say the most difficult conversation today. We were reading his poems, fuck he writes amazing😍So while reading we came across the poem which no one knows about. “Pehli Mulaqat” what happened next is history🥺That expression on S’s face said it all. I didn’t know what to say, how to say😅 Was just searching for some love for me in S’s eyes🥺 S said that the way he loved priyanshi, he can never love like that again and that’s understandable but those expressions🥺 Super mixed feelings! 
But S really know how to calm me down and S tried his level best to do that, guess it’s me who is lacking somewhere. I was trying to find comfort in his words, but couldn’t find any. It is for the 4th time happening that me and S disconnected call with me being upset.  
I don’t doubt S♥️ I know he is going to be with me alwys♥️ Started from March and here we are. Me and S are going to make it till the end💕 lets see what happens

  <p>Finally met S after long🌸S made me meet tharki log today🤐All of them went to Akshat’s farm at morning 5 and s had slept only for few hours😣S was super duper tired😣Ayush and Akshat seemed nice💋Akshat even touched my feet as a joke😂🙈Akshat called me P Bhabhi on call also🙈 That made me blush😋Spent such a great time wish S. he was so tired🥺 We talked and Cuddled🤤 Gudia Rajat prachi came home⚡️ S said to Gudia di that I post my and his stories from his account🥺I don’t remember posting even a single story without his consent on any of his social media handle🥺 All of us went to central park⚡️And I got down as soon as I came back🥺 I wanted S to be with me at that point of time but even S was not feeling well, he was also super tired. Infact, I decided not to call him but couldn’t resist and called him! The way S reacted when I told him that Iam finally down was so so so so so hurtful. Iam in somuch of pain, like literally so much of pain, can’t even describe in words. My back hurts, my stomach hurts, it feels as if each and every bone in my body is breaking. And in a feeling like this I need S with me🥺 And all he had to say was “wow” Iam feeling so so so so bad and hurtful rn. S  just normally texted “uth gaya” I felt so bad yar🥺 How can he behave like this with me🥺 I removed story from S’s account and I shouldn’t have done that🤭I can’t do things out of irritation and anger and definitely not without discussing it with S. moreover, just because he has shared his credentials with me doesn’t mean iam allowed to do whatever I want to with his account😫And it’s not his fault. Iam being too clingy and dependent on him. Which is wrong. Because I know he never says, and he is always always with me but obviously, no one, no person can always be available for you. The other person also has some situations I shouldn’t be like this. 
Me and S spoke about everything and I did made some mess again! S felt as if there is no US in this relation. I didn’t want S to feel this way. I never wanted S to feel anything but happy with me🥺
Me and S decided that from now on I will discuss before deciding, because that’s how you solve problems 
But there are good days and bad days, and we should deal with both😋 We are strong and we will remain like this always💕</p>

  <p>So we both decided to call today as “tension day” 😂 Fuck the entire day was full of nothing but a lot and a lot of problems 😂From the very beginning, me and S were struck with 2 bets placed on trading, and those 2 bets literally took half of the day😂 We were on vc for around 2-3 hours straight and spoke to each other only for 30 mins max 😂 And then when finally everything was settled, a new problem popped up 🥺 I was supposed to meet Samaksh bhaia and Arushi di tomorrow, so we planned and I went to gudia di’s place so that I can leave early morning! And then, suddenly mom called and said no🥺 Shit shit shit, me and S both were super excited for me to meet Samaksh bhaia and Arushi di, and now this🥺🥺🥺 Iam trying so hard so that everything falls in place🥺S is also so so so so upset🥺 Even while on vc we both couldn’t talk about anything else🥺 I so wish everything falls in place tomorrow morning🥺 I so wish everything goes good! 
Bdw, only 2 days left and then S is going away for approximately a month 🥺</p>

  <p>Me and S both were so worried about today’s plan, but destiny has always been in our favor🙈 I finally was able to go and I FINALLY met Samaksh bhaia and Arushi di! I was so so so excited to meet them💕 Shivani bhabhi and avish bhaia was also there, I thought that I would feel out of place but not even once did I feel like that. Bhaia and di are so so so sweet💕 We 6 went to nahargarh and  me S and samaksh bhaia were in the same car. We talked and had a lot of fun♥️ Samaksh bhaia showed me the pre wed and in that video, even S was there🙈 He was playing guitar🙈 I wonder when he will play guitar for me, even though he has played it for me once before😋 Arushi di is super duper sweet💕 I really really liked her♥️ And samaksh bhaia is crazyyyy♥️ I felt so good♥️
It was a bit troublesome day for me and S both, trading went a bit wrong🤭 Went for walk after a really long time today😪 Me and S had a super important conversation, I feel as if this conversation was required. As if it was needed. I got to know a lot of things. Not a lot but yes major things! Destiny, has always played a major role and iam glad this conversation happened💕 
Love you S</p>

  <p>It was super duper important for me to meet S. And I was literally ready to do anything to take permission to meet him, even if it’s for 10-15 miniutes. I had to see him and kiss him. He was going away for long and I wanted to be with him once more💕 And destiny has always, literally always been in our favor. Destiny never fails to be in our favor and we finally met💕 Me and S went to oyo, and as decided, we had sex💕 The second time while having it, I couldn’t bear the pain🥺 S had to go in washroom and had to masturbate, I know he isn’t saying but obviously his exp went bad🤭After having our first round, me and S hugged each other, he was still inside me, and we were in each other’s arm💕 I felt so so so good, that feeling is inexplicable😋Today was the first time when I was lying on S’s stomach, I wanted to do that since so so so long and I did that today🙈 Fuck I felt so good💕 It melted me and my heart💕 That moment when I was lying on his stomach💕 I can never fucking forget it😍We talked and we smoked and then S came on my stomach🙈 S was lying on me🙈I wanted him to lay on me and that happened today💕S was looking at me with no expression on his face, and I felt so so so good😍 Shit that feeling, of him looking at me, caressing my cheek, putting the lock of my hair behind my ear🙈 I felt so good, so loved, so compelte💕 S always, seriously always leaves an impact on me♥️ He always does something which makes me melt, which makes my heart melt💕 He never fails to make me realise how much I mean to him and how much he loves me🙈 Iam so so so blessed to have S with me 💕S is going to noida tomorrow🥺S is going to be away from me🥺There is no surety of when he will be back🥺S is going to be busy and we won’t be able to talk much🥺But I know my S, if he would have just 5 miniutes with him then he would talk just to me♥️I know S will not even for once make me feel bad or unwnated💕 He is my S♥️ He loves me💕 
S was tired when we reached home and he slept and then was busy the entire day! We finally got on vc and started talking and as I said, destiny never fucking leaves us. Maybe it was disturbed for S to know. S logged in my Gmail, and got to know about Yash’s chat! I had promised S tht I won’t hide anything from him and I did it. Maybe in the race of not giving him a reason to leave me, iam actually giving him a reason to leave me🥺 Iam feeling so weird and bad, last time when something like this happened, me and S sorted stuff out and disconnected the call but this time, he said that all is good, but it really wasn’t that good🥺 S’s words didn’t comfort me🥺 S said he loves me but I felt that it’s forceful🥺 I dont wish to question him for it as I know that I deserve it🥺 After all that I have done, S has the complete right to not to talk to me, infact finish everything between us. I really don’t understand why iam doing all this, I always thought that I won’t do anything wrong with him, and even after my best efforts, iam doing something or the other which is affecting us🥺 He says that this isn’t coming between us but I can feel it coming between me and S🥺 I really dont know what’s gonna happen next. But iam promising myself that iam not going to hide any information from my S now. I have said this before and done the same, but now iam not going to do it🥺S is going away and I can’t even meet him tomorrow to sort this out in person🥺 I really wish he doesn’t regret being with me. I wish he doesn’t start doubting me, and start missing her. Fuck this is so painful and hard🥺 Why do I myself have to fuck up everything🥺 Why do I myself have to do things which will leave both of us in pain🥺 I love you S. Please forgive me💕 always yours♥️</p>

Worried how things would be. I didn’t want him to go to noida with us not in good terms🥺 And so I was tensed, his morning snap also was different 🥺We couldn’t have a perfect conversation since morning, until 2.58pm🙈 I was speaking to gitthi, and we were talking about him only💕 And a name flashed on my phone, a call whose i was waiting for “saransh calling”😍 And then, finally💕 We had such an amazing conversation♥️I was feeling so good💕I seriously wonder how the fuck S always manages to calm me down♥️ He is MY S. obviously only he knows how to do it♥️ S was going to noida🥺 I was sick worried about things would be, but I knew S would talk to me even if he would a miniute💕 And that’s what happened♥️ Not even once I felt that S is away from me♥️I sent him my nudes today, after so so so long♥️ I sent him my nudes♥️ And he sent me his dick pic, infront of Arushi di and Samaksh bhaia🙈💕God, I love S so so so so much♥️ I feel I’ll be able to survive these 15 days, I have S by myside♥️ I don’t say it but I know he would read this, so iam kind of directly saying to him that don’t go out of the house🤭 I hope he understands what I mean😋 And S, keep your dick in your pants and tounge in your mouth till you come back.

  <p>So apparently S thought that he can win from me in ludo😂 He challenged me in ludo, even though I was about to win, he got busy and so I left the game, and he won, only and only because I left the game😂Things were normal the entire day but got a little rough towards the end of the day. Initially, I felt that I will be able to survive these 15 days but it’s proving to be a bit difficult😪 I know iam at fault, iam unable to understand his situations, it’s all new for me. This distance, short conversations, divided attention, all of this is super new to me and it takes a bit of a time for me adapt to them🥺 Iam so glad that S isn’t giving up on me🙈 Even though I was wrong, he still managed to calm me down♥️ Iam so happy to have him♥️ He knows that what iam doing at what point of time🙈 At the end, it’s gonna be LDR and I have to get used to it😅</p>

  <p>Really don’t know from where to begin. Maybe with the fact that I was finally getting normal with the changes or with the fact that just as one problem goes away, the second comes😪 Just when I finally, finally started to feel and believe over the fact that yes S isn’t going back, shit happened. This happens with me always, just when I finally start trusting over someone or something, destiny turns around and throws problems on my face. Anvesha called S for her dress, S recorded the conversation. When he sent it to me, for I guess 10-15 miniutes, I was not able to mustup the courage to hear that. I was too afraid to listen to that audio note. I was too afraid to see what power she has on him. I was too afraid too listen what she would say to him and how he will react🤐 Finally, I heard that, and all of my fears came true. I felt as if someone has taken away the most precious thing from me 🥺 That voice, the way he was talking, I could feel the difference in his voice. He had that voice before when me and him were about to drift apart, and this was the second time I was hearing that voice🥺 I was confused tensed worried hurt angry. I was everything. But, I thought that if this is how iam feeling, than what S must be feeling would be worse. Like come on, he can’t behave as if she is a stranger to him. All I could feel and think at that point of time was that S is my bestfriend, and I have to be there for him and support him as his bestfriend. All of the things come later, but he has been so so so so supportive of me, always helped me, and when he needs me, I can’t back off. And that’s what I did. I told him iam there for him. He got free around 4 and we started talking about it. He told me how he felt, he told me what was going in his mind, he told me what he had to face and feel. Shit that was so bad and hurtful, I was trying hard to support him, but I just couldn’t. It made me so vulnerable, knowing that she still has that power on him. Knowing that he wants to know about her whereabouts. That hurt me. That hit me like a storm. And I collapsed. All the courage and all the support that I had mustered up, it all collapsed. All that I had in mind was Me and S and our relationship, and I was ready to go to any lengths to save it. And I did that. 
I was overthinking as usual. Things were normal after a while. That’s not how I wanted my and his 2 month anniversary to begin, but as said, destiny always plays it role. And iam just so glad that he was in noida all this while🥺 Idk how I would have reacted, if he himself would have gone to give the dress. But destiny, Iam so grateful for everything♥️ Just wishing that she leaves me and S alone.</p>

  <p>My hands are trembling even as I write this. What happened today is possibly the worst way we could have celebrated 2 months aniv. I never thought that my and his aniv would go this way. I went to give anvesha’s dress to her place and she said “vo dene aai hai aur tujhe lagta hai mei niche jaungi lene” and that literally upsetted me so much. I felt so bad. I thought that I’ll apologise to her, but I don’t know what have I dont so wrong that I have to go through all of this. I was super angry and filled with rage. I told S that he will not talk to her again, she has disrespected me, and I won’t want him to talk to her. I asked him to block her, and then when I called him again to check whether he has or not he said “kar raha huna, Kya hogaya yaar”. He literally said that. And that not only increased my anger, but hurt me a lot to. Anvesha disrespected me and all he had to say “kya hogaya yaar” I felt so bad. And that bad mood led me to drive super fast and in a very, very bad way. I came to my house, locked my room. Took whiskey and box of cigs into the washroom, and took 3 shots straight of whiskey. Neat. It didn’t buzz me so I lighted up a cig, and started smoking and listenning songs. I so wanted to talk to someone and tried called chahak and gitthi but they both were busy. Those 3 shots literally burned my throat. And as I was empty stomach. The alcohol started reacting. Just then sejal called as she was having a bad time with vibhav, we were talking about it, and as far as i remember. S called me at that time. But then I don’t remember what I spoke to him, what I said to him. It was a black out. I woke up around 5.30 in my bed, and my phone was in the washroom. Called S back and we started discussing. We spoke shortly, i was feeling confused. All of this is so confusing. He calmed me down, but honestly, I don’t think I reallly was feeling better. He was busy and I knew he won’t say that to me at that point of time because I need him. We stopped talking. It’s our anniv today and I expected him to atleast post a story with me, but he was so busy with all his fun and enjoyment that he completely forgot about us. It’s fine I understand, he was busy and so he couldn’t. Iam literally counting days now. When will he come back. Before going, S said that this is going to be a glimpse of how we will be in future. Lets see what happens. Iam super upset about the story thing. But it will go away. Happy 2 months S♥️
Hoping for the best, not really prepared for the worst </p>

  <p>Okay, not so good day. The starting of the day was really nice, but then, something happened. I didn’t really appreciate it🥺 me and S were on a vc, and he said that “aap buhut stubborn ho yar”. That was upsetting 🥺 I felt that he loves me the way iam. I know it’s wrong, I know being stubborn is wrong, but I enjoy being this way, and I thought that S likes that. And okay, I accept that sometimes it might get on his nerves, and it’s okay for him to react this way. He loves me, he loves me a lot, he wants what’s best for me, but I guess, I’ll change things in me when I’ll want them to. And then, he said something I thought he won’t ever say to me. He literally said “Haan mei jab anvesha kesath tha tab meko pure time baat karna pasand nahi tha bilkul bhi, aur ab mei kar raha hu, to iam changing myself na” I didn’t know what to say to him, didn’t know what to tell him. He was comparing me with a person whose even name I don’t like taking. He was comparing my and his relation with his and her relation. He was comparing our moments with his and her moments. I felt so bad, so hurt. Like is there no difference between me and her ? Why would he say something so hurtful to me. Why ? And now that I have realised that he needs his time, I told him that don’t text or call till I dont. I cried so much, like so so so so much🥺 I felt so bad, so hurt🥺 I was seriously not exepecting that he would text or call, I seriously thought that me and him would sleep without talking, but he texted. We spoke about it, I told him what I felt. I told him that he comparing me with her is going to create differences between me and him. I told him everything I was feeling🥺 And then, just like always, he calmed me down. He explained me his view point. He told me that he meant it in a positive way, he explained that with me, he himself wants to do it. He feels that he should give me time♥️ He explained everything to me♥️ He told me that baby, I do it because I want to do it💕 He told me that he was not at all comparing. He explained that, me and her, we cannot be compared at all💕 He told me that baby, the amount of surety he has for me in 7 months, he never had that surety even in 2 years with her. I felt so good💕 He made me feel so good ♥️ I love my S so much 💕 He always, always makes things okay🙈 Love you S💕</p>

  <p>What a day! I really have no words to explain how the went for me🙈 To begin with, i was not at all feeling well so I skipped office and stayed at home. Nose is blocked and iam sneezing, I don’t feel well at all, and S has been so caring towards me 🙈 He has been so attentive and caring, asking me to take medicines and do the things that are required🙈 Fuck I feel so blessed to have him💕He pampers me so so so much♥️ So when I woke up, I saw that Mom has asked me to call her, initially I thought S would say no to talk to her, but he said yes🙈 I was worried and excited to listen what she has got to say☺️ Then I called her, and I think, she is the most sweetest person present on this palnet🙈 She said such amazing things to me🙈 She said she was missing me 🙈She said that when she used to talk to me she used to feel as if there is no problem🙈She said that after meeting me she wants a daughter♥️ God I felt so so so so happy♥️I can’t even describe in it words♥️She asked me to call her and I definitely will call her soon♥️ All this whole S was on conf and I knew he won’t take this very positively. And that is what happened🤨 He felt weird about it🥺 I really get confused by what S feels and says, I mean idk how this is weird. I swear I fail to understand what’s “ajeeb” in this and he always has one solution to every problem, “let’s not talk about it” 🥺 But it’s fine, he reacted this way before also, and it really doesn’t affect now. I just seen to know whether he wants me and mom to be close or not🥺 But no matter what he says, after my conversation with mom today, iam not at all stopping from doing anything💕 I will call her and text her regularly♥️</p>

I feel so bad when I put him in a position where he has to make up for things where he isn’t wrong 🥺 I always promise myself that next time would be different and yet iam the same again🥺 S is so caring so understanding so amazing🙈 And me? I feel so bad that I put him in that position🙊 I feel so so so blessed to have S with me 💕 He will always remain my greatest achievement 💕 Thankyou for always being there with me S and bearing with me ♥️ I love you💕</p>

  <p>Normal day, feeling much much much better today💕 Felt as if S needs some time off me, so didn’t speak to him the entire day, and then when we finally spoke and I told him that iam feeling better and recovering, he, even though as a joke, said that now he won’t able to watch Tanmay bhatt now🤭 He said his night freedom is gone🤭 Okay I know he meant it as a joke, but he said it🤨Umm, it’s weird. I don’t like being said all this. Even as a joke🥺 I know he meant that as a joke, but I don’t like hearing things like this even as a joke . We had yet again a v difficult conversation at night😪 I don’t think I’ll ever be okay with his past🥺  It’s very difficult for me🥺 But we are stronger and it will be all good♥️</p>
