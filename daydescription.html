  <p><span class="nametitle">PRASIDHI:</span>Really don’t know from where to begin, Went to oyo, my first time to oyo, with S. I came 6 fucking times. I can still feel his finger’s sensations over there🙈 We kissed, we cuddled, we almost had sex, we showered together, we laughed, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to rap, we ate pizza. I don’t think there is anything we are left to do with🙈 Those moments when he held me in his arms, when his fingers were in there, when his tounge was teasing me, when he was sucking, god! I guess I had the best bed experience today. I had all of my firsts with S🙈infact, I gave him a blowjob, which I thought I won’t give it to anyone🙈. Iam so going to miss S when I’ll eat, when I’ll lie down, when I’ll shower😭 The best part about the entire day was, when it rained, and we smoked together🤤 Every moment, every kiss, every cuddle. God, I love him so so so so so much. I wish he feels the same. I wish he never stops loving me. I wish he never leaves me. I wish we have the best memories with each other🙈 We had a very difficult conversation tooo, which still is leaving me breathless. It kills me to remember the one conversation.</p>
  <P><span class="nametitle">SARANSH:</span>Ummmm. 😐
Okay. 😐
Hello guchi muchi puchi poo poo.😂
So it all started when I woke up today with the thought of spending at least 6 hours with her today🥰. That thought while waking up was the starting of the best feelings I was going to have today. We met, I guided her to the hotel, we checked in, we went to the room and boom, there was it the first best kiss we had👄. we kissed so hard and so passionately, her lipstick was all over my face💋. Came back after going home for 5 minutes, and FUCK we started kissing so passionately again🙈. Made snaps, cuddled with clothes on, she unbuttoned me, we started having an amazing kiss and one thing led to another then another and there we were without clothes in a blanket in a chilled room in each other's arm in a hotel😍🙈. I touched her everywhere LIKE EVERYWHERE🙈🤭, I gave her so many love bites, all over her boobs and she gave me hickeys too, a lot of hickeys. I know it was not the first time I've been in bed with someone, but yes this was my FUCKING BEST BED EXPERIENCE EVER🤯. We made love, almost had sex but yeah we controlled thanks to her🤗. There was nothing which we were left to do, we hugged, we kissed, we removed each other clothes, we pushed each other in bed, we showered, we ate, we discussed things, we laughed, we smoked, we saw the rain, we watched phineas and ferb, we listened to muhfaad and krishna, there is like nothing left in my life anymore that I've not done today with her💕, now I'm going to miss her while I do anything😭. I made her laugh, I made her laugh so hard and that feeling of making my princess laugh that was the best I could imagine ever❤️🤩. She came 6 times🙈🤭. She is so great with making those expressions, those moaning voices and when she called my name in between of doing that, FUCK🤐. I had the best blowjob of my life ever, fuck she is so great with everything.🤷🏻‍♂️
P👑 still doubts me😔, I think it's just my love that is lacking somewhere, maybe my love is not enough for her.🥺
I felt bad for just one thing, she paid for everything. She paid for the hotel charges and for the food also, that felt so bad, I'll repay her.😭
THE BEST FUCKING DAY OF MY LIFE.</P>
